KYC Mismatch Detection and Resolution System
Overview
The KYC Mismatch Detection and Resolution System is an intelligent solution designed to detect and resolve name and address mismatches in Know Your Customer (KYC) documents. In real-world KYC processes, slight variations in user-provided data often lead to manual exception handling, resulting in processing delays and increased operational costs. This system aims to reduce these exceptions through advanced matching algorithms while maintaining regulatory accuracy.
Features

Name Mismatch Resolution: Handles various name variations including salutations, middle names/initials, and swapped name orders
Address Normalization: Resolves address variations through abbreviation expansion and fuzzy matching
Date of Birth Verification: Handles different date formats and detects potential format confusion
Cross-Validation Logic: Uses multiple fields (gender, DOB) to increase matching accuracy
Confidence Scoring: Provides detailed confidence scores with explanations for each match
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy data input and result visualization

Technology Stack

Python 3.7+
Streamlit: For the interactive web interface
Pandas: For data handling
FuzzyWuzzy: For fuzzy string matching
DateUtil: For date parsing and normalization

Installation

Clone this repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/kyc-mismatch-detection.git
cd kyc-mismatch-detection

Install required dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:
bashstreamlit run streamlit.py


Usage

Open the application in your web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501)
Choose an input method:

Form Input: Enter document details manually
JSON Input: Paste JSON data for both documents
Sample Cases: Use pre-defined test cases that demonstrate various mismatch scenarios


Click "Compare Documents" to analyze the documents
Review the results, including:

Overall confidence score
Match category
Detailed scores for each field
Analysis explanations
Recommendations based on the confidence level



How It Works
The system employs a sophisticated matching algorithm that:

Normalizes Input Data:

Removes salutations, standardizes case, and handles punctuation
Expands common abbreviations in addresses
Standardizes date formats


Applies Fuzzy Matching:

Uses token sort and token set ratios for non-exact matches
Handles swapped name orders and missing components


Cross-Validates Fields:

Verifies matches using multiple fields (name, address, DOB, gender)
Applies different weights to each field based on importance


Generates Confidence Scores:

Provides an overall confidence percentage
Categorizes matches from "High confidence" to "No match"
Adds caution notes for specific issues (e.g., DOB format confusion)



Test Cases
The system has been tested with various mismatch scenarios, including:

Middle name variations
Swapped name orders
Address abbreviations
Complex mixed mismatches
Cross-validation with conflicting data

Requirements

Python 3.7+
Streamlit
Pandas
NumPy
FuzzyWuzzy
Python-Levenshtein (optional, for improved performance)
DateUtil

Future Enhancements

Integration with postal/address validation APIs
Machine learning-based matching for improved accuracy
Support for additional document types and fields
Multi-language support for international KYC processes
API endpoints for integration with existing systems
